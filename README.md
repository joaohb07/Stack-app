## Local Development

> BackEnd only

### Installation

This app is built in [***Node.js***](https://nodejs.org/en/) and uses [***MongoDB***](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) for local development, make sure you have both installed and set before you begin this process. I suggest you also download [***MongoDB Compass***](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell) to get a UI view from your local database.

To install dependencies to run this code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone `backend` branch from this repo:

    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd task-app
    ```

2. Create an environment file `env.env` in `task-app` root folder, with the following variables:

    ```bash
    PORT=3000
    SEND_EMAIL_API_KEY=""
    JWT_SECRET=''
    MONGODB_URL_DB="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/task-manager-api"
    ```

    - `Port` is `3000` by default;
    - Get [***SendGridAPI key***](https://sendgrid.com/solutions/email-api/);
    - Set up your own `JWT_SECRET`, it will be used for hashing and comparing hashed passwords. E.g.: `'batman'`;
    - Mongo db url is `mongodb://localhost:27017/task-manager-api`, `27017` is MongoDB standard port for local DB set, followed by `/task-manager-api` which is the DB name, you can alter if you want to.

3. Use npm package to install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install # or, npm i
    ```

### Usage

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. After you define your Mongo DB path and Mongo DB databases folder, run this command to start your DB:

    ```bash
    sudo /path/to/mongodb/folder/bin/mongod --dbpath=/path/to/mongodb/database/folder
    ```

2. Run one of the following commands to execute the code:

    - Standard run:

        ```bash
        npm run start
        ```

    - Run with `nodemon` **(recommended)**:

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

3. Check the following section to know how to make and test requests to App Endpoints.

## App API endpoints

To test this app Rest API in local development environment, you can download [***postman***](https://www.postman.com/) and import the collection from `postman-collection.json` file of `backend` branch.

You need also to create a [***postman environment***](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments) with the following variables:

- ***`url`:*** `localhost:3000`, port set in `.env` file.
- ***`auth`:*** leave empty, this will be filled when you login or create a user.
